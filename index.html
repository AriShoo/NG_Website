    <p>Lily Pad Hop is a game where you play as a frog trying to start a family.</p>
        <p>The goal of the game is to get the frog to it's mate by crossing various obstacles and avoiding various enemies.</p>
        <p>Once you reach your mate you're ready to play the next level, but as a baby of the previous frog!</p>
        <p>This is a project that has been in the making as part of the college course <a href="about_course.html">HND: Digital Design and Development (Games)</a>. More information can be found about the course by following the hyperlink.</p>
