        <p>Hi! This face you're seeing is mine. My name is Al Sherlock, I've been a artist for 11 years now (freelance for 8) and I'm still learning everything as I go. Just call me a jack-of-all-trades!<br>
            I enjoy making digital art as well as traditional, but I do love getting my hands into some fabric for costume making now and then.
